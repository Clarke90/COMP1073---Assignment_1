I grew up in a small town north of Toronto where simple living and family remain #1. I strarted working working with the web about a year ago and have been adicted ever since. Now adays i have been hand crafting clean, creative web sites for small buisnesses around the community. Using the latest tools to maipulate the web much like a blacksmith. I start with an idea and use tools such as HTML to build the foundation, PHP to menip[ulate, JAVASCRIPT for custom touches & CSS for the final touches. I have experince working with popular content management systmes such as WordPress, Shopify and OpenCart. I always try to be unique and continue on my jorney of becoming a talented web designer/developer.
